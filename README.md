#Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
This is my personal repository for the Coursera course [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning "Course Link").

*Please do NOT use the scripts available in this repo to cheat your way through the course.*
The course material is of very high quality and I highly recommend solving the problems on your own.
